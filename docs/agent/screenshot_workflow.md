# Screenshot workflow (AI saves and compares pictures)

Recipe for an AI client that needs a picture of the emulator screen: to
check what a program draws, to compare it with an expected picture, to
cut out one part of the screen, or to save every changed frame of an
animation (frame series).

Use `emu_screenshot_save_to_file`. It writes a PNG straight to a file on
the server host, so no large base64 payload goes through the context; read
the written file afterwards. (`emulator://frame/screenshot` returns the
whole framebuffer as a base64 PNG, only for small checks.)

## Geometry

The emulator framebuffer has **one pixel per GDG clock horizontally and
one per picture line vertically**. The picture area (canvas) is 640
framebuffer pixels wide, so in the 320-dot modes one dot of the computer
is two framebuffer pixels side by side.

| Build | Framebuffer (with border) | Canvas (picture only) | Canvas offset |
|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| MZ-800 | 928x288 | 640x200 | 154, 46 |
| MZ-700 PAL / NTSC | 704x232 | 640x200 | 32, 16 |
| MZ-1500 | 704x232 | 640x200 | 32, 16 |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `path` | file path | PNG to write (absolute path recommended) |
| `area` | `full` (default), `canvas` | whole frame with the border, or the picture only |
| `scale` | `framebuffer` (default), `native`, `"1"` to `"4"` | see below |
| `crop` | `{"x", "y", "width", "height"}` | cut-out in output pixels, only with `framebuffer` or `native` |

- `framebuffer` - framebuffer pixels 1:1 (MZ-800 full 928x288, canvas
  640x200). The behaviour without parameters.
- `native` - **one image pixel per dot of the computer**. When all pairs
  of neighbouring framebuffer pixels in the area are equal (320-dot
  modes), the width is halved: MZ-800 canvas 320x200, full 464x288;
  otherwise the width is kept (640x200, 928x288). Lines 1:1. The reply
  has `hires: true` when the 640 width was kept. Use this to compare with
  pixel data of the program (sprites, VRAM contents, a converted image).
- `"1"` to `"4"` - the aspect ratio of the emulator window; `"2"` equals
  the window at 100 % (MZ-800 full 928x576). For a human-looking picture.
  Scale `"1"` drops every second column in the 640-dot modes.

The reply: `{"available": true, "path", "format": "png", "width",
"height", "byte_size", "area", "scale"}` (+ `hires` with `native`).
`available: false` + `reason` = no frame rendered yet (just after start).
An unknown value or a crop outside the image is an error; no file is
written.

## Recipes

**Check what the program drew (MZ-800 graphics):**

```python
emu_run(frames=50)
emu_screenshot_save_to_file(path="C:/tmp/screen.png", area="canvas", scale="native")
# -> 320x200 (or 640x200 in the 640-dot modes); one pixel = one dot
```

**Only a part of the screen**, e.g. a 256x192 window in the middle of a
320x200 picture (a ZX Spectrum style playfield):

```python
emu_screenshot_save_to_file(path="C:/tmp/field.png", area="canvas", scale="native",
                            crop={"x": 32, "y": 4, "width": 256, "height": 192})
```

**A picture for a person** (looks like the emulator window):

```python
emu_screenshot_save_to_file(path="C:/tmp/shot.png", scale="2")
```

## Frame series - finding animation bugs

`emu_screenshot_series_start` saves a PNG of **every emulated frame that
differs from the last saved one**. Use it when something flickers, jumps
or tears in an animation and you need to see the exact frames.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `emu_screenshot_series_start(dir="", area="full", scale="native", crop=None, only_changed=True, frames=0, max_files=0)` | Starts the series. Empty `dir` = a new `<platform>_frames_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` folder in the screenshot output folder. `frames` > 0 = stop after that many emulated frames. `max_files` = safety limit (0 = 10000). |
| `emu_screenshot_series_stop(wait=True)` | Stops; with `wait` returns after all queued frames are written. |
| `emu_screenshot_series_status()` | `active`, `writing`, `frames_seen`, `files`, `unchanged`, `dir`, `stop_reason` (`Stopped`, `Frame count reached`, `File limit reached`, `Error`), `last_error`. |

How it works:

- Frames are taken in **emulated time** at the end of every frame, so
  none is skipped even at MAX SPEED. When writing cannot keep up, the
  emulation waits. Nothing is captured while the emulation is paused.
- "Changed" is decided on the **resulting image**: only differences
  inside `area` and `crop` count. Crop to the sprite you follow and the
  rest of the screen (score, border, blinking cursor) is ignored.
- Files `frame_NNNNNNN.png`: NNNNNNN = emulated frame since the start of
  the series. Gaps = frames that did not change. `index.csv` has
  `frame,file,gdg_screen` (`gdg_screen` = absolute GDG frame counter).
- Only one series at a time; a second start is an error.

**Recipe - capture 3 seconds of an animation exactly:**

```python
emu_pause()                                     # at the scene to examine
emu_screenshot_series_start(dir="C:/tmp/anim", area="canvas", frames=150)
emu_run(frames=150)                             # 150 emulated frames = 3 s PAL
st = emu_screenshot_series_status()             # wait until active and writing are false
# read C:/tmp/anim/index.csv, open the frame_*.png files in order
```

With `only_changed=False` every frame is saved (to see how long a state
lasts).

## Related state

- `emulator://periph/gdg` - display mode (`regDMD`), palette, border; on
  the MZ-800 also `vramctrl` (VRAM write / read format WF / RF: write mode,
  planes, VBANK) and `hwscroll` (hardware scroll SOF, SSA, SEA, SW in port
  units, `enabled`). Useful when the picture does not match the expected
  VRAM contents.
- `emu_run(frames=N)` - advance exactly N emulated frames before taking
  the screenshot.
